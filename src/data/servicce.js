        description: `Teeth cleaning is part of oral hygiene and involves the removal of dental plaque from teeth with the intention of preventing cavities (dental caries), gingivitis, and periodontal disease. People routinely clean their own teeth by brushing and interdental cleaning, and dental hygienists can remove hardened deposits (tartar) not removed by routine cleaning. Those with dentures and natural teeth may supplement their cleaning with a denture cleaner.Before the actual cleaning process begins, they start with a physical exam of your entire mouth.The dental hygienist uses a small mirror to check around your teeth and gums for any signs of gingivitis (inflamed gums) or other potential concerns.If they detect major problems, the dental hygienist might call the dentist to make sure it’s fine to proceed.`

        name: 'Orthodontics',
        description: `Orthodontics is a branch of dentistry that treats malocclusion, a condition in which the teeth are not correctly positioned when the mouth is closed. This results in an improper bite.Treatment can be cosmetic, to improve a person’s appearance, but it often aims to improve oral function, too.
      An orthodontist can carry out work that aims to achieve the following:
      1.closing wide gaps between the teeth
      2.aligning the tips of the teeth
      3.straightening crooked teeth
      4.improving speech or chewing ability
      5.boosting the long-term health of gums and teeth
      6.preventing long-term excessive wear or trauma of the teeth
      7.treating an improper bite
      8.Treatment can improve the appearance of the teeth, but it can also lead to better chewing and speech function and help protect teeth from damage or decay, in some cases.`
